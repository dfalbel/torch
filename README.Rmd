# torch

torch from R!

## Installation

Before installing you should [install libtorch](https://pytorch.org/) in `usr/local/lib/`.

``` r
devtools::install_github("dfalbel/torch")
```

## Example

Currently this package is only a prrof of concept and you can only create a Torch 
Tensor from an R object. And then convert back from a torch Tensor to an R object.

```{r}
library(torch)
x <- array(runif(8), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
y <- tensor(x)
y
identical(x, as.array(y))
```

## Simple Autograd Example

Now let's look at the most important feature of torch. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- tensor(1, requires_grad = TRUE)
w <- tensor(2, requires_grad = TRUE)
b <- tensor(3, requires_grad = TRUE)

y <- w * x + b
y$backward()

x$grad
w$grad
b$grad
```
